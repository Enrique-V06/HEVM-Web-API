# Web-API Quiz

## Description

This application was built in order to help prepare vacations better depending on the weather forecast of the place the traveler wants to visit.
I made this application to help travelers check the current weather and the forecast for the following 5 days so they can prepare in advance dependeing on how the weather will be during their visit to the selected city.
This was acheived by calling the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) and using the different type of calls you can make in order to retrieve the coordinates of the searched place, and then obtaining the weather and forecast for the next 5 days.

## Usage

As soon as you load the page you are presented with 3 buttons, the first shows the high scores saved in the local storage, the second one resets the quiz, press it whenever you need to reset it, the last one just like itÂ´s text says starts the quiz:

After clicking the Start Quiz button you are presented with a series of questions you have to answer, but be careful since avery wrong answer will reduce 10 seconds from the time you have to answer the quiz.
